    "# Coursework Part 1: Detecting Spam with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tasks for IN432 Big Data coursework 2020, part 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework is about classification of e-mail messages as spam or non-spam in Spark. We will go through the whole process from loading and preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. A few additional elements will be introduced here, such as the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, which is linked from this document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is similar to the lab sheets. A code structure is provided with gaps that you are supposed to fill in. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \n",
    "please leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous comments have been added in the text and code cells to guide you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outputs, but download the notebook by clicking on *File* ➡︎ *Download .ipynb* (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle. This part counts for 50% of the total coursework."

Then, all the actions are performed on the values Rdd so that we can zip them with keys RDD in order to keep original order as we know that zipping two Rdds pairs each element of first rdd with the corresponding element of second. After that, we performed filttering to remove records from values RDD, so we need values to be joined with their corresponding keys in order to remove the (key, value) pair. Alternatively, if we remove records from values RDD before zipping it with Key RDD, then we would need to  manually look for corresponding keys and remove them from key-RDD before grouping key and value RDDs together. This last-mentioned approach is not very proficient.  \n"

    "Training and test accuracies are indicative of overfitting and underfitting. If the training accuracy is substantially higher than test accuracy then our model is overfit whilst in case our model has poor performance on both training and test set then it is an underfit model. From above results, we can examine that there is insignificant difference between  training and test accuracies, which is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will inspect the effect of different sizes of test vector on the performance of models. For N=3 and 30, there is almost no difference between training and test performance of models. This demonstrates that, as a result of small vector sizes, our models do not have enough attributes to learn in order to separate the classes. In case of N = 300, logistic regression has 100% accuracy on training data while its test performance is 93%, which is likely to be lower than training performance. Also, the performance of naive bayes is slightly increased as opposed to its performance with small values of N. Following this, for N = 3000 logistic regression model has 100% training performance and 96.9% test performance. An interesting point is that, the test performance of naive bayes has increased to 96.2% as compared to 84% with vector size N = 300. For the largest N = 30000, logistic regression has approximately same performance while the performance of naive bayes has decreased.This depicts that, after a certain value of N we are just adding noise. The most notable point is that, Support Vector machine has same training and test performance for all values of N. Furthermore, the best performance of all the models has been obtained at N=3000.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the effect of pre-processing on models performance, we trained our models on different types of pre-processed datasets. Either removing stopwords or lemmatization has increased the test performance of logistic regression from 96.9% to 97.6%, other than that there is not any remarkable difference in the performance of models. Also, there is no change in the performance of Support vector machine on different types of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, logistic regression has the highest accuracy, after that Naive bayes and then SVM.\n",
    "Given that Naive Bayes are Genrative models they generally have a better accuracies as compared to Discrimintive models i.e. logicstic models, when there is insufficient data. This is due to the fact that  Generative Models (Naive Bayes) reach their asymptotic solutions for fewer training sets than the Discriminative Models (Logistic Regression). When the training data size is large or approaches infinity, we can expect better performance in Logistic Regression, as is in our case having 2893 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, should expect SVM to outperform the Logistic regression model, however this is not the case. One possibilty is due to class imbalance, which is the case for our spam filtering task, as we have 2412 documents labeled Not Spam and 481 labeled spam.In this situation, accuracy might not be best metric to assess the performance of models.\n",
